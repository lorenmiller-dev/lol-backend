services/ - Start by creating a service module that handles all 
    interaction with the Riot API. This encapsulates the API logic in one place and exposes clean functions for getting data.

controllers/ - The controllers handle the business 
    logic for your app's features. You could start these early and stub them to return mock data.

routes/ - The routes define the API endpoints and 
    map them to controllers. Not much logic here, so lower priority to start.
    
models/ - You may want to hold off models until you 
    can populate them properly with data from the API via controllers/services.
